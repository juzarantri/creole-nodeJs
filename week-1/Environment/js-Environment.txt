    What is the JavaScript ecosystem?

        -> The JavaScript ecosystem is a collection of software packages, libraries, and other resources that facilitate development as they integrate with each other. Those tools are created by different developers and providers â€“ for example, the React library is powered by Facebook, while the nodejs developed by Ryan Dahl .

    



> For Running the JavaScript in environment

    What is a Runtime Environment?
    
    A runtime environment is where your program will be executed. 
    
    It determines what global objects your program can access and it can also impact how it runs.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    JavaScript can be execute in web browsers , local and remote machines.

    for web browsers -> 

                    1. Create External Script in environment and attached it to the file ( html ) .
                    2. Use Script tag to write the script in html file .
    
    for local machines ->

                    1. Install NodeJs in environment and execute the script by passing the script file .

                    syntax  : node path/file.js
                    Example : node file.js 

    for running the script in online mode ->

                    best web in my opinion

                        - https://codepen.io/

                        - https://playcode.io/ 
                        
                        Feature i like the most

                        ( where you don't need to open the devtool for console logs )

    
> IDE / Code Editors

    ->Sublime Text 3 ( simple / easy but not good for complex / large projects )  ( Free )

    -> WebStorm ( Paid ) from JetBrains software family 

    -> Vs Code ( not "Visual Studio" this is different from that . this is lightweight source code editor with ) ( Free )

    -> in my opinion use vs code editor this is great i have worked with this tool for more than a year . this tool have many extensions that helps you to make your project management easy , code formatting , automatically code completion .

    -> the most important it has git integrated so no need to open another terminal for that with gui where not commands need to be typed.

    -> the second most important Feature where when you open the editor and change the content of the file you can see the changes like git in timeline

    , but after closing the editor it will be cleared.
