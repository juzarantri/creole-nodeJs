Types of functions in javascript?

Named function

Anonymous function

Immediately invoked function expression. It runs as soon as the browser finds it.


1 ) Named function


Named function is the function that we define it in the code and then call it whenever we need it by referencing its name and passing some arguments to it. Named functions are useful if we need to call a function many times to pass different values to it or run it several times.

2 ) Anonymous function

The anonymous functions don’t have names. They need to be tied to something: variable or an event to run.


3 ) Immediately invoked function expression— ( IIFE ) 

Invoked function expression runs as soon as the browser encounters it. The benefit of this function is that it runs immediately where it’s located in the code and produces a direct output. That means it is unaffected by code which appears further down in the script which can be useful.
